#Bickery

Bickery is a javascript version of the delay discounting task described by Bickel, Odum, and Madden (1999) in *Psychopharmacology*. A hyperbola-like equation with two fitted parameters -- k (discounting rate) and a (sensitivity) -- described by Myerson and Green (1995) is used to fit the user's data.
